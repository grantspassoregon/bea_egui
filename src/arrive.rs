/// The `arrive` module holds error handling types for the `tardy` crate.
///
/// With the announcement that [`derive_more`] has gone version 1.0.0, they added that the `Error`
/// implementation was capable of replacing `thiserror` in most cases.  As a long-time user of
/// `thiserror`, this caught my attention.  I also started seeing different errors when using the
/// question mark operator on new error types.  *Other libraries* were using [`derive_more`] for
/// their error types.  It appears I was witnessing a shift in the ecosystem.  In order to get with
/// the program, I am starting from scratch implementing error handling using [`derive_more`].
///
/// This process requires implementing [`derive_more::From`] for the error types I want to handle.
/// What is unclear in the documentation is that the [`Error`] type provides a [`Error::source`]
/// method.  Without calling this method and displaying the source, I lose the connecting thread to
/// the causal issue.  Here I have tried piping the error into the display, we will see if it
/// works.
///
/// The `Blame` enum is the primary [`Error`] type.  The purpose of `Blame` is primary to enable
/// conversion of errors from other libraries into a common type using the question mark operator.
/// Library-specific errors fall under the `Excuse` variant, which contains an [`Excuse`] enum with
/// variants for different internal error conditions.
